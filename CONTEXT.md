# Ohmyfood project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

You have just been recruited by Ohmyfood! as a junior developer. Congratulations!
Ohmyfood! is a young startup that would like to impose itself on the restaurant market. The objective is to
to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to
traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose the menu for their meal so that the dishes are ready when they arrive.
the dishes are ready when they arrive. No more waiting in restaurants!

### My role

You are one of the four lucky ones who have the chance to work on this beautiful project. <br />
The team consists of : <br />
Paul, the CTO of the future site; <br />
Fanny, the UX designer recruited to put the site in the colours of Paris; <br />
Anissa, the sales person in charge of canvassing restaurants; <br />
and you, in charge of developing the site. <br />

For this project I had to create HTML and CSS code based on a model, images and a brief were given to me. I used SASS to style the site, I also had to create a bunch of animations with CSS here and there like a loading spinner and a growing heart when hovered on.
